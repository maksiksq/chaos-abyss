Each one has its own pros and cons, keep that in mind.</p>\n<section id=\"popularity-comparison-and-why-it's-sorta-a-lie\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n<h2 tabindex=\"-1\">Popularity comparison and why it's sorta a lie</h2>\n<p>To give you a little bit of context, here are some popularity rankings according to <a href=\"https://2024.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks\">State of JS</a>. These can give you a lot of insight, but don't jump into conclusions. More popular does not equal better, in fact, often the opposite. Why?

Not very. It uhh, pretty bad. Don't get me wrong, it's not unusable, but it's definitely not the most fun and stable.</p>\n<p>And also a lot of people's problem with React is corporate backing - made and maintained by Facebook, influenced by Vercel as a sponsor, and a ton of companies who just got used to it. It's not just 'oh noie this big bad evil company owns this thing I use', it seems to impact the direction the library itself is going.</p>\n<p>But it's not all gloom and doom, React is still viable and often just necessary, it's not 'dead'.</p>\n<section id=\"pros-and-cons%3A\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n<h3 tabindex=\"-1\">Pros and Cons:</h3>\n<section id=\"pros\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n<h4 tabindex=\"-1\">Pros</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Huge Ecosystem:</strong> This is the main selling point of React when there are other frameworks in the conversation.

You install lots of libraries for everything and each library has its own quirk and bug or two, and it all stacks up into a horrid mess.</li>\n<li><strong>It's Slow:</strong> React is the hungriest of the 3, and where you're the likeliest to come to a performance bottleneck which also directly impacts search engine optimization (SEO), add a pile of libraries on top of that too.</li>\n<li><strong>Learning curve:</strong> The syntax is not fun and not easy.

I personally started out with React and I hated it! Then I learnt Vue and loved it, and then Svelte to which I gracefully switched fully unless I need some specific thing, but that doesn't have to be that way for you. Go with the most logical option based on the thing you're making, or follow your heart, I guess :idk_emoji:.</p>\n<p>Official tutorial links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>React: <a href=\"https://react.dev/learn\">here</a></li>\n<li>Vue: <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/tutorial/#step-1\">here</a></li>\n<li>Svelte: <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/tutorial/svelte/welcome-to-svelte\">here</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, an incredibly important thing a lot of articles like these miss: in context of front-end frameworks, it's also very important to consider the full-stack framework of your choice, you're very likely going to interact with it, at least eventually - for React that's Next.js, for Vue - Nuxt.js and for Svelte it's SvelteKit or some others.</p>\n<p><em>Insert article plug about those whenever I get to making it</em></p>\n<p>Also, these three are not the whole matchup, there are many other JS UI frameworks - <a href=\"https://angular.dev/\">Angular</a>, <a href=\"https://qwik.dev/\">Qwik</a>, <a href=\"https://www.solidjs.com/\">Solid.js</a> and more!\nAnd it's not limited to JavaScript, there are Rust frameworks like <a href=\"https://yew.rs/\">Yew</a> and <a href=\"https://leptos.dev/\">Leptos</a>. It's a big, wide world, but it's an overwhelming one. Gotta get started somewhere.</p>\n</section>\n"
