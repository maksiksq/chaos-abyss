As a wise man once said. Crickets.

Truly devious creatures of the night. No, really, they are nocturnal creatures, as I've had the irritating experience of discovering.

**TL;DR:** My solution was light. I plopped down a garden light, and they went there like the idiots that they are.

## They're loud

In my room with a half-open window, their sounds get to 60-70 decibels. For context, my laptop's speaker (singular) playing music at full volume does just about as much when measuring right near the speaker (according to an app on my phone*). It's not painfully or dangerously loud, just incredibly annoying, particularly when you're trying to fall asleep.

One solution would be to stay up till about 4-5 AM until the summer ends, because that's when they stop chirping, but you might find some issues with that solution.

## How did I get rid of them?

Well, apparently just like a lot of bugs, they're attracted to light. I'm not exactly sure why. It's either due to them using it for navigation, or because they might associate light with prey, like glowing insects, probably both.

So I plopped a garden light somewhere far away from my window. Worked like a charm.

Now the sound is still there, but it's distant and more than comfy enough for me. A few of my family members confirmed when walking at night all the crickets were gathered there too.

Ta-da!


## Also, warning: Cricket math

### Why do they even cricket?

Apparently it's their mating call, and the louder it is, the more they stand out, thus the annoying sounds.

### Dolbear’s Law

Apparently, they chirp more as the temperature raises. And there's even Dolbear’s Law which is a way to estimate temperature by counting the chirps. And that sounds interesting, so I tried it.

The formula is pretty simple, based on the number of chirps in 60 seconds we get the temperature in Fahrenheit.

$$
T_F = 50 + \frac{\text{Number of chirps in 60 seconds} - 40}{4}
$$
There's also a simplified formula, which is just:
$$
T_F = 40 + \text{Number of chirps in 15 seconds}
$$

So I counted. My crickets kind of do it in waves, and you're supposed to isolate a single cricket, which made it kinda hard. I would just use Audacity on my laptop and count the spikes in the waveform, but my microphone was only picking up some static, which is fair enough. It's not meant for crickets, it's meant for my voice.

I decided to use the 15 second formula. This and my counting are in no way scientific, but when counting the amount of cricket chirps ever was? I guess it was if this law exists.

I ended up with about 16 waves from a single cricket (they have like a voice basically so I can separate one), and I averaged it out to about 5 chirps per wave. So about 80 chirps in total, plug it into the formula and that's 120° Fahrenheit, which converted from freedom units is 48° Celsius. Uhm. Yeah, we're frying on this one, it's actually a cool 23° night right now.

It might be the law being kind of inaccurate or my sloppy counting, but it didn't work for me, lol. Even if I count again and reduce the number generously, or try to count for the whole 60 seconds, it's not even close at all.

Most likely, I just have a different kind of cricket. Here in Vinnytsia, Ukraine we probably have some kinda different species than Dolbear after whom the law was named. A USA-only law, I guess. *eagle noises intensify*

To get an actually accurate result, I could record the temperature and the number of chirps at different temperatures to eventually get a more accurate formula for my exact environment and crickets.

But that kind of defeats the purpose, like I imagine myself stuck in a forest trying to figure out what season it is and counting crickets out of desperation, not doing a field study.

A more accurate formula for my crickets seems to be something like:
$$
T_F = 50 + \frac{\text{Number of chirps in 15 seconds}}{4}
$$
Speedy crickets = fewer seconds, I guess.

This is, however, from my very limited dataset of a few samples in two consecutive nights.

## In the end
It worked. I sleep. They chirp ... somewhere else. Perfection.
