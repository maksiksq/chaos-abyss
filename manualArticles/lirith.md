You like what you see here? Sometimes I wish we lived in a completely different world, a world where struggle is optional. Where you could level up if you wanted to. Where your life isn't controlled by the whims of lousy people like mine or maybe yours too.

I guess it's kind of a core principle of escapism? It hurts, we run. But enough sad talk, because we need ways to keep going.

For me, staying organized is a bit of a problem. I tend to forget things, get distracted, or just not feel like it.

To deal with that and not forget things like watering some pickles on Friday evening I've tried a bunch of tools, and I kinda figured they suck. Some of them feel like they're preying on you with ads and oh god lots of useless AI features, and the ones that aren't, apart from a few very notable exceptions feel basic and don't really work for me.

And I'm still kinda stuck finding the thing I want. I got a few rather unorthodox things that do work but, it's inconveniencing. So I'm making the thing I want. I'm making the thing I predict would work. Making an app - Lirith.

The concept revolves mostly around using blocks basically like a desktop and micro mnemonics to make you remember your stuff, keeping it in your eyes all the time so you can't forget, and making it as customizable as possible because it's not just a me problem you know.

## The ideas

One day I started placing files on my desktop, it was something like "reminder to use this thing". And well, I wake up, stare at it, hard to miss that. That worked so well that I now have over 60 text files on my desktop being kinda ugly. Another day I was brainstorming the places I look most often, then I realized my phone notifications are free real estate. And these ideas have been piling up in the same notes on the desktop.

My biggest problem with a typical to-do list is that I won't use it unless I explicitly remember about it. Eventually, I'm surrounded with a lot of tasks, and I kinda check it out once in a while to see if there's something I forgot. It's pretty awkwardly scoped. Project focused apps are nice, but you can't use them universally for all tasks and general life.

And if something that works for me doesn't work for you, then find what fits your mold. I want it customizable but not overly complex, which is quite a task in itself.

Lastly, quality assured, I'll take my time with it. Not just because I don't want to ruin expectations, no I just need a good app to use myself too of course he-he.
