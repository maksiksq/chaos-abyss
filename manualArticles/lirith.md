# What's text?

You like what you see here? Honestly. Sometimes I wish we lived in a completely different world, a world where struggle is optional, a world where you could level up if you wanted to. Where your life isn't largely controlled by the whim of some lousy politicians like mine and quite possibly yours.

I guess it's kind of a core principle of escapism? It hurts, we run. But enough sad talk, cause we need ways to keep going. 

For me staying organized is a bit of a problem. I tend to forget things, get distracted or just not feel like it. 

This is definitely not as bad for me, as for some people. I basically never put stuff off despite that, I always try to get rid of the tasks at hand first before doing anything instead of procrastinating which is good for me, the bad thing is that it feels awful. I didn't really feel like making this thing, knowing that I have to, and then I'll forget and get distracted.

To counter this and to generally not forget that I had to water some pickles on Friday evening I use some tools, but after trying out most apps out there I kinda figured. Duh. They suck, a lot of them feel like they're preying on you with ads and oh god lots of useless AI features, and the ones that aren't just feel very basic.

My biggest problem with a typical to-do list is that I won't use it unless I explicitly remember about it. Eventually I'm surrounded with a lot of tasks and I kinda check it out once in a while to see if there's something I forgot. It's pretty awkward. Some say to "plan out every hour of your day to stay efficient" with a calendar app but I can't see that happening for any reasonable alive human being.

And I'm still kinda stuck finding the thing I want. I got a few rather unorthodox things that do work but it's inconveniencing. So I'm making the thing I want. So I'm making the thing I predict would work. So I'm making Lirith.

The concept revolves mostly around using blocks basically like a desktop and micro mnemonics to make you remember your stuff,  keeping it in your eyes all the time, so you can't forget, and making it infinitely customizable because it's not just, a me problem you know.
