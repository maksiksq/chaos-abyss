You like what you see here? Honestly. Sometimes I wish we lived in a completely different world, a world where struggle is optional, a world where you could level up if you wanted to. Where your life isn't largely controlled by the whim of some lousy politicians like mine and quite possibly yours.

I guess it's kind of a core principle of escapism? It hurts, we run. But enough sad talk, because we need ways to keep going.

For me, staying organized is a bit of a problem. I tend to forget things, get distracted, or just not feel like it.

To counter this and to generally not forget that I had to water some pickles on Friday evening I use some tools, but after trying out a lot of apps out there I kinda figured they suck. Some of them feel like they're preying on you with ads and oh god lots of useless AI features, and the ones that aren't apart from a few very notable exceptions feel very basic and don't really work for me.

And I'm still kinda stuck finding the thing I want. I got a few rather unorthodox things that do work but, it's inconveniencing. So I'm making the thing I want. I'm making the thing I predict would work. Making Lirith.

The concept revolves mostly around using blocks basically like a desktop and micro mnemonics to make you remember your stuff, keeping it in your eyes all the time, so you can't forget, and making it infinitely customizable because it's not just, a me problem you know.

This is definitely not as bad for me, as for some people. I basically never put stuff off despite that, I always try to get rid of the tasks at hand first before doing anything instead of procrastinating which is good for me, the bad thing is that it feels awful, and it's often hard to focus and ends up inefficient.

My biggest problem with a typical to-do list is that I won't use it unless I explicitly remember about it. Eventually I'm surrounded with a lot of tasks and I kinda check it out once in a while to see if there's something I forgot. It's pretty awkward. Project focused apps are nice, but you can't use them universally for all tasks.
