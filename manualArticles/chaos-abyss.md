# How I made Chaos Abyss.
blurb: Sort of a devlog in post.

I'm almost done with furnishing and publishing this place, and usually at this point normal people would say something engaging along the lines of "I am so excited to present to you - Chaos Abyss!", but no, I'm just tired, not from making this project but from existing. And that doesn't mean I'll stop. I'll keep making things. I'll keep filling in the abyss deep inside my soul. Owa, that took a wrong turn.

This is a blog/publication, I guess? Hard to call it a real publication, but at the same time it's probably higher quality than most actual publications. I guess I'd call it a curated blog. Gotta rewrite the about page now, with that in mind lol.

## What is Chaos Abyss?
Here is where I cast my whimsy into the world. Some stuff here is serious, and some stuff is not very serious. All you need is to look at the discovery page right [here](/articles).

## Just another blog?
I've been working on this project for the last ~20 days about 6-12 hours a day, although there were some irl complications so it's probably a bit less than that, but my Hackatime timer is ticking 160 hours on this project, which only includes coding time and Figma usage which isn't the full extent of it too. 

That said, it's totally just another blog, nothing taking that away.

And yes, I could just make a website with wordpress or any other cms and I had the unfortunate experience of doing that for money (the money is nice tho, yoink). But that would just lose so much of the aforementioned whimsy, so much creativity, so much experience and flexibility; making it myself is fun, and that's exactly the thing I hated about those cms commissions I made in the past, it was not fun at all. 

Plus I just learnt Svelte and SvelteKit a month ago, and never before I made so much back-end and a well-polished blog is a nice entrypoint to that. The next blog will take me 10 days, and the one after that will take 5. If I ever need to make another personal blog that is, which is unlikely but you get the point.

I took some inspiration from Medium and Tofugu, particularly how an article should even look like. Medium is just a cringe posting website, but it has some nice UI and I bloody love reading Tofugu articles, they're so well written and well-made. 

One thing that I wish I could incorporate more in here is art. As you can see, the thumbnails for most articles are in a specific minimalist style, which looks cool and all, but I'd like to draw something, but then it's going to take me an eternity to post one so that's simply unrealistic in the current state of my life. Maybe I'll work on that in the future tho.
