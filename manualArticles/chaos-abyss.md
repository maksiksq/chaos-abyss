# How I made Chaos Abyss.
blurb: Sort of a devlog in post.

I'm almost done with furnishing and publishing this place, and usually at this point normal people would say something engaging along the lines of "I am so excited to present to you - Chaos Abyss!", but no, I'm just tired, not from making this project but from existing. And that doesn't mean I'll stop. I'll keep making things. I'll keep filling in the abyss deep inside my soul. Owa, that took a wrong turn.

This is a blog/publication, I guess? Hard to call it a real publication, but at the same time it's probably higher quality than most actual publications. I guess I'd call it a curated blog. Gotta rewrite the about page now, with that in mind lol.

## What is Chaos Abyss?
Here is where I cast my whimsy into the world. Some stuff here is serious, and some stuff is not very serious. 

I've been working on this project for the last ~20 days about 6-12 hours a day, although there were some irl complications so it's probably a bit less than that, but my Hackatime timer is ticking 160 hours on this project, which only includes coding time and Figma usage which isn't the full extent of it too.
