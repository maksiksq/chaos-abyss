// The weirdness of Pineapples in Japanese

Sometime, someday I heard that there are ~42 languages in the world that use the word *ananas* or its derivatives, except English because English is funny as always. And this made me wonder if that's the case for Japanese as well. Never encountered the word before (look at me, an amateur), so I looked it up, and it's actually kinda wonky if you look into it deeper.
## A little not little bit of history

It's worth mentioning that a lot of these languages have the word *ananas*, but it's not the most common word for it, for example in Spanish there is *ananas*, but actually the common way to say it is *piña*. Also, English is kind of weird for using *pineapple,* but it's not the only one doing so, it's kind of framed badly, I guess.

We'll get to how this relates to Japan in a sec, but first, the history behind this boils down to influence: <br>
### The Spanish
Basically, the story goes, Columbus found America, welcome to somewhere in the Bahamas, probably. The Tupi natives gave him their *ananas*, which were the first fruit brought from America to Europe. They didn't know that tho, idiots were totally convinced they found India, and called it *Piña de Indes* aka Indian pinecone. Which I mean. Does this look like a pinecone to you?

# And then the Portuguese

So sometime after that, the Portuguese decided they were going on a trip to India. Well, it's obvious how that went.

The fate that awaited them in Brazil was ... also *ananas*, but this time they called it the same, sorta, it was *nanas* in native Tupi people's language but sure. And so the Portuguese did a lot of trade, and eventually spread it everywhere around the world.

### And then it went to the English

In English we ended up with *pineapple* because originally the word for what we call *pinecone* in English today was the *"pineapple"* in question, so the fish and chips enjoyers kind of followed the same logic as the Spanish and named it *pineapple* which means *pinecone*. Except later they renamed *pineapple* (the pinecone) to *pinecone* so a pineapple is not a pinecone, but a pinecone is a pinecone, and that's how we ended up here, it is totally not confusing at all no, wdym.

Also as a Ukrainian, I wanna say, it's just straight up ananas (ананас) here. 

### So what was Japan doing in all that?

They got the word.
