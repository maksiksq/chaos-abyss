[# The Final Boss of Japanese Names: Kira Kira
 
// Japanese names that have been made up to look unique ... often without an account of the actual meaning.

One of the interesting parts of Japanese society is names. Since their names use kanji (chinese characters) which can carry different meanings and pronunciations.

## Japanese names

So a typical Japanese name is, for example, {陽向|ひなた} (Hinata) consisting of two kanji, 陽 - meaning something like "sun", and 向 meaning something like "to face, to turn towards" so the name roughly translates as "Toward the sunlight". And the dynamic that most popular Japanese names follow is meaning something positive. 

## Evil

How optimistic. Now it's time for {悪魔|あくま}, which literally means devil/demon. Yes, there was an actual court case about some parents naming their child a devil in 1993, quoting the dad here: "If you hear it once, you’ll never forget the name. ... It is the best possible name". I mean, he's not wrong. His idea was that he can raise the child in a way that will prevent him from getting bullied even with such a name.

After some tribulations, the court allowed keeping the name but only as {亜駆|あく} meaning something like subpar run (an underdog?). He also said he'll name his next son Emperor, but luckily that never happened. In 1996 he divorced his wife, shortly after that he was arrested for drugs. 

Later when he got the legal right to, the son changed his name and surname at the age of 18. You see the problem; some parents don't really consider what their children's life will be with such a name, or have a warped idea of that like the aforementioned guy. 


## Kirakira

These weird and unique names are called **キラキラ (kirakira)** names. The word means "glittering", "sparkling" in other words, shiny names.  

### Things you typically see in these names:

- **Unusual readings for kanji:**<br>
  <small class="desc">E.g. {紅葉|メイプル}　(Meipuru) - maple.</small>
- **References:**<br>
  <small class="desc">For example {光宙|ピカチュ}　(Pikachu) - literally Pikachu, yes, the Pokemon. With light and air.</small>
- **Foreign words or names:**<br>
  <small class="desc">In addition to the aforementioned Maple, there are also names like {真九州|マックス}　(Makkusu) - Max, but written in kanji.</small>
- **And just weird names:**<br>
  <small class="desc">Like {王子様|おうじさま}　(Oujisama) - Prince.</small>

Them being written with weird kanji makes them difficult to recognize for most people. {奇跡|ダイヤ} (Daiya) meaning Diamond would typically be pronounced as kiseki, which is the usual usage of the kanji, the word means "miracle".

Here's a list:
| Name                 | Origin          | Written as      | Comment                                                                 |

| {夏夏夏} (ななみ)     | -  | summer + summer + summer  | It's the kanji for summer repeated thrice. |
| {精飛愛} (せぴあ)     | Likely Sepia  | spirit + fly + love  | Sepia is a name for a color or a yellow/brown filter which makes things look kinda sad.  |
| {キック今日中|しかた} (きっくきょうじゅう)     | -   | kick sometime today ???  | I hope they don't mean literally kicking their children. Apparently, it's a slang term meaning a dumb delinquent. |
| {詩香多|しかた} (Shikata)     | -   | poem + fragrance + multiple  | In Japanese しかたない (shikatanai) means "there's nothing we can do", so their name is going to be eternally joked as 詩香多ない. |

| {今鹿|なうしか} (Naushika)     | Ghibli film   | now + deer   | The sacrifice you have to make to be possibly read as Nausicaä instead of Now deer.|

| {北子|のこ} (Noko)       | -             | north + child      | The existence of a Noko (half english from North) implies the existence of a Soko, Eastko and Westko.                                                                 |

| {奇跡|ダイヤ} (Daiya)       | Diamond                | miracle           | This is just confusing.                                                                         |

| {王子様|オウジサマ} (Ojisama) | -                | prince            |                                                                         |


**Honorable mention:** {野風平蔵重親|のかぜへいぞうしげちか} (nokazeheizoshigechika) - apparently: "The mother was a rekijo (history-loving woman), and she wanted to give her child both a childhood name and an adult name like the samurai did in the old days. But since that wasn’t allowed, she ended up just combining everything into one big name." 



A lot more of these are inappropriate or almost inappropriate than you'd expect.
