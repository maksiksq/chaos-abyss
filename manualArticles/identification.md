If you think about it. Think about it really hard. Identification as a main game mechanic is kind of underrated.

In like detective or some puzzle games you often collect clues which kind of collect clues that lead up to a thing, but that's not what I'm talking about.

Imagine you get an item. And it's a staff. But stuff of what kind? It's all *???* oh no what does that mean. It is kind of something that you see in games from time to time, some kind of unknown, but it's usually for some rare item, or you're underleveled for it, so this just adds suspense. It's mystery - not identification.

What I'm talking is, imagine a game where you get stuff, and you have no idea what that is, instead of collecting some clues for progression, you have to make some relevant assumptions from discovering other things or even completely separate concepts and then deduct what an item does.

A rock? A rock of what? Let's name it a rock of steel, no The Rock of Steel.

## Side mechanics?

Combat, fishing, building these are all side mechanics in big games that got turned into separate games with them being the main focus, a fully fledged experience. But some of these game mechanics for one reason or another never took off separately, and in my opinion, the most interesting one of them is being absolutely clueless.

Identification of items is always either requiring some appraisal or straight up a given: you got it, and your character all of a sudden knows what "Dinosaur Mayonnaise" is.

And I mean, in most games, idk Dark Souls, you probably want to know what your item is and what it does because how else are you going to make a build out of it, going and identifying it even if it were a fun minigame or something would be a big chore.

## Why underrated?

Because I can't think of anyone making this into a game yet. The closest thing I know is like [Strange Horiculture](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574580/Strange_Horticulture/), I haven't really played it much yet, but I love the concept. This is a game about being a plant store owner in a strange world, you have plants and serve some customers with them using some of their magical properties. You got a book that gives you some descriptions of plants, the issue is, it doesn't actually show you the full plant, it's more of a clue. Until you completely identified the plant, you can label it with anything you want, but you don't actually know.

In my head this is definitely great for these store owner games, the aforementioned Strange Horiculture, stuff like [Potion Craft](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1210320/Potion_Craft_Alchemist_Simulator/), well that's because identifying plants fits the setting. But I can imagine this expanded to identifying items of any kind.

Another interesting thing about those two is that when you give the customer an item, you don't actually know if that is what they wanted. Like in Potion craft if someone has their door jammed, 

Just throwing out some ideas:
- The world from the future and the past collided, and now you have to tell medieval peasants what to do with a washing machine they scavenged
- Weapons, staffs, etc. have some idk gems embedded with them, by figuring out the combinations of them, with a complex magic system you try and find out what they do. And then sell them. Because stonks.
- A difficult to pull off concept, but listen, what if the artstyle makes it difficult to figure out what an item is. You're a freaking colorblind person, and the world it too stylized to make out details, you have no bloody idea.
