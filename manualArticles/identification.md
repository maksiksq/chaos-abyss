If you think about it. Think about it really hard. Identification as a main game mechanic is kind of underrated.

In like detective or some puzzle games you often collect clues which kind of collect clues that lead up to a thing but that's not what I'm talking about.

Imagine you get an item. And it's a staff. But stuff of what kind? It's all *???* oh no what does that mean. It is kind of something that you see in games from time to time, some kind of unknown, but it's usually for some rare item to add suspense. It's mystery - not identification.

What I'm talking is, imagine a game where you get stuff and you have no idea what that is, instead of collecting clues on a thing.
