Note: This is highly inspired by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKuhRoSVizs) by Mental Checkpoint, except about a different mechanic, go check it out after this.

If you think about it. Think about it really hard. Identification as a main game mechanic is kind of underrated.

In like detective or some puzzle games you often collect clues which kind of collect clues that lead up to a thing, but that's not what I'm talking about.

Imagine you get an item. And it's a staff. But stuff of what kind? It's all *???* oh no what does that mean. It is kind of something that you see in games from time to time, some kind of unknown, but it's usually for some rare item, or you're underleveled for it, so this just adds suspense. It's mystery - not identification.

What I'm talking is, imagine a game where you get stuff, and you have no idea what that is, instead of collecting some clues for progression, you have to make some relevant assumptions from discovering other things or even completely separate concepts and then deduct what an item does.

A rock? A rock of what? Let's name it a rock of steel, no The Rock of Steel.

## Side mechanics?

Combat, fishing, building these are all side mechanics in big games that got turned into separate games with them being the main focus, a fully fledged experience. But some of these game mechanics for one reason or another never took off separately, and in my opinion, the most interesting one of them is being absolutely clueless.
