# ðŸªž Chaos Abyss

Man reinvents blog framework from scratch.

It's a blog. I'd write a descriptive readme but checkmate, I explained it elsewhere, twice.

## Elsewheres in question: <br>
> [The initial article](https://www.chaos-abyss.com/articles/projects/chaos-abyss) - the juicy details, the soul, the evil <br>
> [About page](https://www.chaos-abyss.com/about) - the idea more or less

## TL;DR:
Personal blog forged in the fires of curiosity and obsession. Includes a lot of interesting thingies, I recommend - 9/10. Docked a point for the lack of pancakes.

Developed to be fast, maintainable, seo compliant, with a11y and nojs in mind, and uses a lot of custom implementations because fancy and fun. [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) one love, best js framework ever.

Also, I spent way too much time on easter eggs... Begin your search.
